Hours to complete assignment (optional, but encouraged!):

15+, although I've been sick while trying to complete large parts of this assignment, and that slowed my coding down.

/**********************************************************************
 *  In what parts of the assigmment does using recursion make the 
 *  program simpler? In what parts does it make it more complex? Why?
 **********************************************************************/

//answer goes here.

Simpler- checking rows, columns and boxes for a valid int location was made faster using recursion. This also made the solving method simpler (despite its inherent complexity).

More complex- recursive was so difficult as to be nearly impossible, and at 3/15 this assignment the requirement to recursively scan was not met due to this diffficulty.

**********************EDIT 3/16******************************
After working through the recursive scanning, I found the solution; although the scanning was difficult.

I frankly have little to no idea how to recursively scan in puzzles. I do not understand if this is supposed to be done by passing the scanner on, or by passing the file, or just the general concept of how I am supposed to recursively make a puzzle while scanning it in. 

*****************************************EDIT 3/16******************************************************

Recursive scanning and recursive solving were difficult to find the logic for, but I eventually found the solution

This assignment was interesting, but the requirement to recursively scan in the puzzle has frustrated me extensively. I intend to resubmit this assignment within the next day after working through this requirement.


*************************************************************EDIT 3/16******************************************************

After reworking throught the homework for an extra day, I have successfully met most of the requiremnts. My main problems would be not making helper methods private
